      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Sustainability in agriculture refers to farming practices that meet
        current food and textile needs without compromising the ability of
        future generations to meet their needs. This concept encompasses various
        dimensions:

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Sustainable agriculture
        minimizes environmental impact by preserving natural resources, reducing
        pollution, and enhancing biodiversity. This can involve techniques such
        as crop rotation, cover cropping, and organic farming methods.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>Economic Viability:</strong> Sustainable practices ensure that
        farming remains profitable for producers. This includes fair trade
        practices, providing farmers with a stable income and market access for
        their goods.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>Social Equity:</strong> A sustainable agricultural system
        promotes social equity by supporting local communities, ensuring fair
        wages for workers, and fostering community development.
